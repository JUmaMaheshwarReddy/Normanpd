# About

The Norman, Oklahoma police department regularly reports cases.
The website contains three types of summaries arrests,
incidents and case summaries.
The main goal of our project is to extract the data information
from a scrapped file which is a PDF file in the 
[Oklahoma Police Department](https://www.normanok.gov/public-safety/police-department/crime-prevention-data/department-activity-reports)
In this project we are only considering daily incidents and the extracted data
is stored to a sqlite3 database and display the total types of nature(reason for arrest) and
with their count(how many same nature arrests has happened) which is seperated by a pipe '|'.
